Credit Risk Prediction on Home Credit dataset - GA Capstone Project

In developing countries, many people struggled to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. 

The primary goal of my project is to assign an internal credit score for each unique customer by utilizing a variety of alternative data such as telco, housing, vehicle and transactional information to predict clients' repayment abilities. I tuned my model to ensure that clients who are capable of repayment are not rejected on their loan application which would lead to revenue loss for the company. 

The dataset is provided by Home Credit Group, a non-bank financial institution that strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience.
